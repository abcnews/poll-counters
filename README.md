# poll-counters

Manage our **firebase** `poll-counters` project, which stores counts for multiple-choice poll answers across many stories, allowing increments / totals via cloud functions.

## Getting started

Install **firebase**'s tools globally:

```sh
$ npm install --global firebase-tools
```

Install cloud functions dependencies locally:

```sh
$ cd functions
$ npm install
```

Read the [getting started](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/get-started) guide for working with cloud functions.
